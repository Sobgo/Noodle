# Noodle course management system

Noodle is an online course management system designed for both eLearning and conventional on site education support.
It provides educators with customizable spaces for sharing educational materials with students and allows managing access to said materials.

Noodle was designed to handle content in a responsive manner and can be used on both large and small screen devices. It can also be installed on mobile devices as PWA.
